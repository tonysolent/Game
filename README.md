<h5>Technologies Used</h5>
<p>The Game Discovery Platform is built using the following technologies:</p>

</h7>Front-end:</h7><br>
<p>HTML: Markup language for creating the structure of the web pages.</p>
<p>CSS: Styling language for visually enhancing the application.</p>
<p>JavaScript: Programming language for client-side interactivity and logic.</p>
<h8>Back-end:</h8><br>
<p>Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.</p>
<p>Express.js: Web application framework for handling server requests and responses.</p>
<p>EJS: Templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML pages.</p>
<h8>Database:</h8><br>
<p>CSV: Simple file format for storing game data in a tabular structure.</p>
<p>MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture: A software design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components: the model (data and business logic), the view (user interface), and the controller (handles user input and updates the model and view).</p>
<p>Git: A distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.</p>
<p>MongoDB: A popular NoSQL database that provides a flexible, scalable, and document-oriented data storage solution.</p>
<p>Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, used for building scalable network applications.</p>
<p>EJS (Embedded JavaScript): A templating engine that enables the embedding of JavaScript code within HTML markup to dynamically generate web pages.</p>
<p>Express: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building robust and scalable web applications.</p>
<p>By utilizing the MVC architecture, you can separate your application's concerns, making it easier to maintain and extend. Git enables you to track changes in your codebase, collaborate with other developers, and manage different versions of your project. MongoDB provides a flexible and scalable database solution that can handle the storage and retrieval of your application's data. Node.js, along with the Express framework, allows you to build efficient and scalable web applications using JavaScript on the server-side. Finally, EJS simplifies the process of generating dynamic web pages by allowing you to embed JavaScript code within your HTML templates.</p>
